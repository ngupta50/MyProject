Library file RunTimeConvClassifier.py contains RunTimeConvClassifier class.

Class Instantiation: Following arguments are required to create an instance 
   of a RunTimeConvClassifier.
   Modelfile: Saved model file after training the model
   DicFileStem: Stem of dictionaries created by textdata object
   EmbeddingFile: Memory mapped word embeddings used during pre-processing 
                 the training data

Once an instance of RunTimeConvClassifier is created, its 'hypothesis' method
can be used to quary for the class of a given text string and possibly the external 
feature.

Method:
   hypothesis(inputString, fe, Dist=False): 
      inputString: Text to be classified
      fe: space saperated sparse representation of exteral features (needed only
          if the model was trained using external features. Each feature is described
          as index:value. If :value is omitted it will be assumed to be a binary feature
      Dist: Flag, if specified, returns a hash containing probability distribution
          of all the classes. Otherwise it returns the top class.
